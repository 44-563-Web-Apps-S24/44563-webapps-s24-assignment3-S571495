            My favourite book is "The Vampire Diaries". It is a popular young adult book series written by L.J. Smith. The series revolves around the supernatural happenings in the fictional 
            town of Mystic Falls and follows the love triangle involving the protagonist, Elena Gilbert, and the vampire brothers Damon and Stefan Salvatore. What sets this series 
            apart is its combination of romance, drama, and the supernatural, captivating readers with its compelling characters and intricate plot twists.
            The success of the books led to the creation of a hit television series adaptation that further expanded the franchise's popularity.

            I like the movie 'The Meg'. It is a 2018 science fiction action-thriller film directed by Jon Turteltaub.
            the film follows a deep-sea rescue diver who is recruited to save a crew trapped in a submersible at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. 
            As they conduct the rescue mission, they encounter a prehistoric, massive shark known as the Megalodon, believed to be extinct. 
            The film combines suspense, thrilling underwater sequences, and a mix of humor, making it an entertaining and action-packed shark movie.
